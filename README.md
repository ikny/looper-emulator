# looper-emulator
Warning: not even a minimum viable product

Looper emulator was supposed to be a free linux application which would make creating music as easy as looper pedal or loop station.
This high-school project is currently unusable due to high latency caused by low speed of python. Nevertheless, it enabled me to practice writing of clean code, explore OOP design patterns and last but not least discover threading and other CS concepts.

## Why?
I wanted an app which:
- is free,
- is simple and intuitive to use,
- allows you to create music live and on your own.

Looper emulator aims for smoothness of use. Moreover, it prioritizes A GUI that is quick to understand over the amount of features.
